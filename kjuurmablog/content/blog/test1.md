Today is the day I finally make my first post on my own page. Technically, it is not 100% mine, because I used Hugo and custom theme for setup. The reason I'm using Hugo is that it requires a bit more effort on the technical side, which is a bonus on my journey to learn programming. 

Even though there's a lot of materials on the internet to setup a simple blog on Hugo, It still took me several evenings to figure out the final layout settings. Changing things only through Linux terminal or trying to understand Hugo templates takes a lot of time for a first-timer. I also didn't want to write whole HTML and CSS from scratch, because even though I could do it, it would've taken even longer. And in the end, part of being a good programmer is taking advantages of the tools you have, isn't it?
